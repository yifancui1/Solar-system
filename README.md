## Desription
This work is extended based on CSC418 2020W Assignment 6 shaderpipline, which build a small earth-moon system.

In this project, I extended it to render the whole solar system, including Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. As well as thousands of small planets showing the whole universe.   
Note: The solar system is not at the correct scale and orbiting speed. The colors and textures are just approximations.

The main modifications includes:
* main.cpp: extend the model from 2 objects to more
* model.glsl: change the model of all new objects
* planet.fs: change light source and all colors and shapes (perlin noise bumps)

## To execute:
run [shaderpipeline](build-release/shaderpipline) under [build-release](build-release)
```Bash
cd build-release
./shaderpipeline
```
